This library provides an **easy-to-use**, **comprehensive**, and **flexible** way to work with satellites data (for now: [S1_GRD](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S1_GRD), [S2_SR](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_S2_SR) and [LANDSAT8_T1_TOA](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/LANDSAT_LC08_C02_T1_TOA)). Its key advantages include: a **well-documented** API, **support** for the mainly used satellites, **open-source code**, and **regular updates**.<br>
In addition to the already mentioned advantages, the implemented code **relies on Google Earth Engine (GEE) APIs** (used to access satellites data and perform some tasks such as *cloud masking*, *image compositing*, and *time series selection*) and **exploits multi-threading** (designed to work efficiently, by making a lot of parallel I/O requests to GEE).

These advantages make it an excellent tool for anyone working with satellites data, since it allows to *generate datasets that can be both easily used for data analysis and efficiently integrated with well-known ML libraries, to deploy models*.

**How to install it?**
```bash
$ pip install ee-satellites
```

This library is composed of lot of functions, the main ones are here described.

## `get_features()` function

It allows to get from an [input pandas DataFrame](#input-dataframe) composed of fields information, [an output DataFrame](#output-dataframe) that contains for each time [selected satellites](#how-to-execute-it) (sentinel-1, sentinel-2 or landsat-8) passed over the specified fields, within a given time period, all the mean values of some of the most used indexes (optical or radar).

The `filters_params` parameter is a list (default: `None`) containing the values of the Earth Engine filters to be used for extracting Image Collections, with the specified sentinel satellites. For Sentinel-2 the first parameter in the list is the value of the `CLOUDY_PIXEL_PERCENTAGE` filter (`LESS OR EQUAL TO` - values in range `[0, 100]`), whereas for Sentinel-1 the first parameter in the list is the value of the `orbitProperties_pass` filter (`ASCENDING` or `DESCENDING`).

The `fields_threads` parameter (default: `4`) is the number of threads to dedicate to parallelization of requests over the fields level, the remaining part instead is used to apply parallelization over dates level. The value of this parameter should be high (with respect to the overall number of threads exploitable) if you have a lot of fields but a little time-span to consider, whereas if you have fewer fields but a bigger time-span you should decrease this parameter. Finally, if you have lot of fields with lot of dates to process it should may be optimal considering half of the overall number of threads available. <br>A correct choice of this parameter can drastically reduce the features extraction time.

See the [code](https://github.com/Amatofrancesco99/master-thesis/blob/main/Notebooks/1-features-extraction/utils/ee_satellites.py) for a better understanding.

## Input DataFrame
The input DataFrame, lets suppose named `fields_df`, should be structured as follows (just columns position matters):

| field_name      |              polygon_coordinates                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| P-BLD           |  [(-4.202723286616649, 43.39683579015289), (-4...]|
| P-BLLT1         | [(-4.085622203603083, 43.429605845026266), (-4...]|
| P-BLLT2         | [(-4.084840437376829, 43.430826294936246), (-4...]|
| P-CBRCS1        | [(-4.200826431306206, 43.39067464298489), (-4....]|
| ...             |             ...                                   |
| P-VNS 	      | [(-4.151167740565273, 43.40535762666503), (-4....]|


## How to execute it?

First you have to initialize and authorize the Google Earth Engine APIs.

```python
import ee, ee_satellites

ee.Authenticate()
ee.Initialize()
```

Then, supposing that you have already loaded the `fields_df` pandas DataFrame, you have just to run the following code. Change the `satellite` parameter value in case you want `sentinel-1`, or `landasat-8`, indexes extracted for the fields specified (within the time period selected - be careful that the given date format is consistent with [ISO 8601](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) notation). See the above [general description](#get_features-function), instead, to comprehend what `filters_params` and `fields_threads` parameters are useful for.

```python
df = ee_satellites.get_features(fields_df, '2022-01-01', '2022-12-31', satellite='sentinel-2', filters_params=['40'], fields_threads=3)
```

## Output DataFrame
The output generated DataFrame, namely `df`, will be structured as follows:
| field_name | s2_acquisition_date | B1 | B2 | B3 | ... | MCARI2 | BSI | GLI | ALTERATION | SDI |
|------------|---------------------|----|----|----|-----|--------|-----|-----|------------|-----|
P-BLD | 2022-01-06 | 2.260204    | 119.981293  | 550.044218  | ...  | 0.922907 | 6282.955014  | 0.513069 | 2.131255 | 3484.508503 |
P-BLD | 2022-01-16 | 13.785714   | 111.540816  | 528.481293  | ...  | 0.921371 | 6545.200602  | 0.517949 | 2.127614 | 3636.382653 |
...   | ...        | ...         | ...         |	...	     | ...  | ...      | ...          | ...      | ...      | ... | ...   |
P-VNS | 2022-11-17 | 1133.057399 | 1364.994619 | 1726.755157 | .... | 0.594553 | 11195.020251 |	0.070841 | 1.441033 | 1939.695067 |
P-VNS | 2022-12-17 | 955.040359  | 1208.792825 | 1617.324664 | ...  | 0.688394 | 10547.592756 |	0.107797 | 1.505526 | 2913.218834 |
