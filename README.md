## **Description**
This is the repository for the project *"Detection of manure application on crop fields leveraging satellite data and Machine Learning"* [[thesis]]().

## **Abstract**
> Detecting when manure has been applied on crop fields is crucial for many purposes, such as maintaining soil fertility, productivity, environmental compliance, and for verifying farmers' adherence to nitrates directive. 
To achieve this, time series of mean spectral indexes (radar, optical and thermal) have been extracted from specific regions of interest (ROIs), located in Spain and Italy, using different satellites (a [*Python library*](https://pypi.org/project/ee-satellites/), available for public use, has been developed in order to efficiently extract those indexes).
After that, the spectral indexes most impacted by manure application have been identified, and different Machine Learning models have been compared, especially for what concerns their generalization capabilities.
A brief summary of the most important obtained results is that there is homogeneity of spectral response to the manure application of crops located within the same country, and that combining optical and thermal indexes allows achieving the best classification performances, for both the two ROIs (the same is not true for radar indexes).
The proposed method provides a valuable foundation for developing a tool to monitor manure application in crop fields and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.

```

## **Notebooks**
### Features extraction
The objective of the [*features extraction notebook*](./Notebooks/1-features-extraction/notebook.ipynb) is to extract useful mean indexes values from crop fields of interest, using satellites imagery.
To facilitate the feature extraction process, a Python library called [`ee-satellites`](https://pypi.org/project/ee-satellites/) has been created and made available on the PyPI repository for public use.

### Analysis
The objective of the [*analysis notebook*](./Notebooks/2-analysis/notebook.ipynb) is to analyze the datasets generated in the previous notebook by performing data visualization, obtaining statistics, and exploring correlations between different indexes. The main goal is to identify which optical and radar indexes are most affected by the application of manure on crop fields. To assess the significance of feature importance, a t-test has been used.

### ML models
The [*ML models notebook*](./Notebooks/3-ml-models/notebook.ipynb) aims to build and compare various machine learning models for detecting the application of manure in crop fields. The models are evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Several critical aspects are covered, including overfitting and underfitting, dataset balancing (undersampling or oversampling), feature subset selection (wrapper methods), performance evaluation (stratified K-fold cross-validation), and feature normalization techniques.

### Generalization
The notebooks inside the [*generalization folder*](./Notebooks/4-generalization) are designed to assess the generalization capabilities of a *selected pre-trained model*. The objective are: [(i)](./Notebooks/4-generalization/notebook1.ipynb) to evaluate the performances (of model) in detecting when crop fields have been manured in a completely different context from the one it was trained on (different country, soil types, climate conditions, farming practices, ...); [(ii)](./Notebooks/4-generalization/notebook2.ipynb) to check, using a model trained on all available manured crops located in a country of interest (Italy), the distribution of detections during a whole reference year for crops (same country) where there are no information about the actual manure application date/s. <br>
Generalization is a critical issue, as it determines how well a given model can perform on new, unseen data.

Please consider that each notebook has its own `utils` file or folder.
